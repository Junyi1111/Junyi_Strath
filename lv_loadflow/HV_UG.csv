Introduction,,
,,
This spreadsheet specifies a UKGDS Phase One generic High Voltage network in the UKGDS standard format.,,
This is the HV Underground network (HV UG).,,
,,
Cells in red show data entered directly and represents the UKGDS standard format data for the generic network,,
Cells in blue are functions of other cells,,
Cells in black are notes or fixed values,,
,,
Description and Summary Analysis,,
,,
The HV UG model is an 11kV urban network fed from a 33kV supply point.,,
,,
The high-level characteristics of this model are as follows:,,
,,urban area
,,short circuit length
,,high customer density
,,underground construction
,,radial topology
,,small overall size
